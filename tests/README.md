## Persistent Test Account

The seed script `scripts/seed/seed-test-wallet.ts` provisions a persistent test account used by both Playwright and vitest E2E tests. It is idempotent -- safe to run multiple times.

```bash
pnpm db:seed-test-wallet
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `pr-test-do-not-delete@techops.services` |
| Password | `TestPassword123!` |
| Org Slug | `e2e-test-org` |
| Org Name | `E2E Test Organization` |
| Role | `owner` |

The script also seeds a **Para wallet** (EVM) linked to the test organization, required for `write-contract-workflow.test.ts` and any test that needs on-chain signing. The wallet data is hardcoded from the pre-provisioned Para wallet (same wallet used by keeper-app). No Para API calls are made at seed time.

**Environment variables required for wallet seeding:**

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection |
| `TEST_PARA_USER_SHARE` | Raw Para user share (base64) |
| `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts user share at rest |

If these env vars are missing, the user + org are still created but the wallet step is skipped.

## When to Write a Playwright Test vs a Vitest E2E Test

### Playwright (browser E2E)

Use Playwright when the test **requires a browser** or validates **user-visible behavior**:

- UI rendering, layout, and interaction (clicks, form fills, drag-and-drop)
- Navigation flows (sign up, onboarding, page transitions)
- Visual state after actions (toasts, error messages, saved configs reloading)
- Full user journeys that start in the browser ("create workflow, configure trigger, save, reload, verify")

Playwright tests live in `tests/e2e/playwright/`. They run against a live (or deployed) app with a real database. The test user authenticates through the actual sign-up/login UI or via the persistent test account.

**Config:** `playwright.config.ts` -- serial execution (`fullyParallel: false`), single worker, 2 retries, chromium only. Reporter: `github` + `html` in CI, `list` locally. Auto-starts `pnpm dev` locally (disabled in CI and deployed environments).

### Vitest E2E (API/infrastructure)

Use Vitest when the test validates **backend behavior** that does not need a browser:

- API endpoint correctness (auth, status codes, response shapes)
- Database operations and record lifecycle (create, update, query execution records)
- Infrastructure integration (SQS send/receive, DB connectivity, RPC failover)
- Script behavior (workflow-runner exit codes, graceful shutdown, signal handling)
- On-chain interactions (balance checks, gas estimation, nonce management, real transactions)
- Pipeline flows (dispatcher -> SQS -> executor -> API -> runner)

Vitest E2E tests live in `tests/e2e/vitest/`. They connect directly to the database and infrastructure services. Some spawn child processes (workflow-runner). Some hit live RPC endpoints.

**Config:** `vitest.config.mts` -- excludes `tests/e2e/playwright/`, uses `tests/setup.ts` for mocks and env defaults.

### Decision rule

If the assertion is about **what the user sees in the browser**, use Playwright.
If the assertion is about **what happens in the database, queue, API, or chain**, use Vitest.

## Testability Signals

Components should announce their state explicitly via data attributes so that Playwright tests can wait deterministically instead of guessing from DOM side effects.

### Principles

1. **Components announce, tests listen.** A test should never have to infer readiness from child element counts, text content, or CSS classes when a data attribute can state it directly.
2. **Prefer expectation waits over selector waits.** Use `await expect(locator).toHaveAttribute()` over `page.waitForSelector()` where possible -- it reads better and aligns with Playwright conventions.
3. **Signals are for state transitions, not static content.** A static heading doesn't need a signal. A panel that fetches data before it's interactive does.

### Signal Types

#### `data-ready` -- async readiness

For components that load data or initialize before they're interactive. Boolean string.

```tsx
<div data-testid="workflow-canvas" data-ready={String(isCanvasReady)}>
```

```typescript
await expect(page.getByTestId("workflow-canvas")).toHaveAttribute("data-ready", "true", { timeout: 60_000 });
```

**When to add:** Any component that fetches on mount, initializes a library (React Flow, Monaco), or waits for a WebSocket connection before the user can interact.

**Current usage:** `workflow-canvas.tsx`

#### `data-page-state` -- page-level lifecycle

For pages with distinct render branches (loading, error, empty, ready). String enum.

```tsx
<main data-page-state={pageState}>
```

```typescript
await expect(page.locator("[data-page-state]")).toHaveAttribute("data-page-state", "logged-in-match", { timeout: 15_000 });
```

**When to add:** Any page that computes state from async sources (auth status, API calls, URL params) and renders different branches based on the result.

**Current usage:** `accept-invite/[inviteId]/page.tsx` with states: `loading`, `error`, `not-found`, `logged-in-match`, `logged-in-mismatch`, `logged-out`

#### `data-state` -- component lifecycle

For components with multiple operational phases. String enum. Follows the same idea as `data-page-state` but for sub-page components (panels, overlays, switchers).

```tsx
<button data-testid="org-switcher" data-state={switcherState}>
```

```typescript
await expect(page.getByTestId("org-switcher")).toHaveAttribute("data-state", "ready");
```

**When to add:** Stateful components where the test needs to distinguish between loading, ready, switching, or error states -- especially when the visual difference between states is subtle (spinner vs content swap).

**Current usage:** `org-switcher.tsx` with states: `switching`, `loading`, `ready`

#### `data-testid` -- stable selectors

For identifying elements that tests need to locate. Not a state signal, but the foundation that other signals attach to.

```tsx
<div data-testid="action-grid">
```

**When to add:** Any element that a test interacts with or asserts on. Prefer `data-testid` over CSS classes or text matchers for elements that are structurally important to tests.

**Naming:** Use kebab-case. For dynamic IDs, use `{component}-{identifier}` (e.g., `action-option-http-request`, `action-node-abc123`).

### What NOT to signal

- **Static content** that doesn't change after render -- test it with text matchers or role selectors
- **Internal component state** that has no user-visible effect -- tests shouldn't know about implementation details
- **Transient animations** -- wait for the end state, not the transition

### Adding signals to existing components

When retrofitting a component, the priority order is:

1. Does a test currently use `waitForTimeout()` or `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` to wait for this component? Replace with a signal.
2. Does a test wait for a child element as a proxy for parent readiness? Add `data-ready` to the parent.
3. Does a test check multiple DOM properties to infer which state the component is in? Add `data-state` or `data-page-state`.

### Current coverage

| Signal | Component | Values |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `data-ready` | `workflow-canvas.tsx` | `"true"` / `"false"` |
| `data-ready` | `kpi-cards.tsx` | `"true"` / `"false"` |
| `data-ready` | `runs-table.tsx` | `"true"` / `"false"` |
| `data-ready` | `time-series-chart.tsx` | `"true"` / `"false"` |
| `data-ready` | `workflow-runs.tsx` | `"true"` / `"false"` |
| `data-page-state` | `accept-invite/[inviteId]/page.tsx` | `"loading"`, `"error"`, `"not-found"`, `"logged-in-match"`, `"logged-in-mismatch"`, `"logged-out"` |
| `data-state` | `org-switcher.tsx` | `"switching"`, `"loading"`, `"ready"` |
| `data-testid` | 20+ components | See Key Selectors Reference in CLAUDE.md |

## CI Execution Model

All E2E tests are managed by workflow files under `.github/workflows/`.

### Trigger summary

| Event | Ephemeral vitest | Ephemeral playwright | Remote playwright |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Push to `staging`/`prod` | Yes | Yes (gates deploy) | Gated by `ENABLE_E2E_REMOTE_TESTS` var (post-deploy) |
| PR with `run-e2e-tests-ephemeral` label | Yes | Yes | No |
| `[skip e2e]` in commit message | Skipped | Skipped | Skipped |

Ephemeral tests are gated by the `ENABLE_E2E_EPHEMERAL_TESTS` repo variable. When disabled, e2e jobs become no-ops and deploy proceeds unconditionally.

### Execution order on push to staging/prod

```
ci-pipeline.yml:
    |
    +-- build-images.yml (Docker images to ECR)
    |
    +-- e2e-tests-ephemeral.yml (needs build-images)
    |        |
    |        +-- e2e-vitest-ephemeral (DB + SQS + built app)
    |                 |
    |                 +-- e2e-playwright-ephemeral (DB + built app, serial)
    |
    +-- deploy-keeperhub.yaml (needs build-images + e2e-tests, blocked on failure)
    |        |
    |        +-- deploy (Helm to EKS)
    |        |
    |        +-- e2e-playwright-remote (against deployed URL, gated by ENABLE_E2E_REMOTE_TESTS)
    |
    +-- release.yml (prod only, needs deploy, blocked on failure)
    |
    +-- docs-sync.yml (prod only, needs release)
```

### Playwright stability decisions

- **Serial execution** (`fullyParallel: false`, `workers: 1`): shared persistent test user session makes parallel unsafe
- **Retries: 2**: handles environmental flakiness; 3 consecutive failures = real failure
- **No sharding**: single runner completes full suite in ~6 min; sharding added cost without speed gain
- **Deterministic waits**: `data-ready`, `data-state`, `data-page-state` attributes replace `waitForTimeout()` and `networkidle`
- **Reporter**: `github` in CI (annotates PRs), `list` locally

## Running CI Locally with `act`

[nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) can emulate GitHub Actions workflows locally. The default `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` image is missing tools that GitHub runners include (`pg_isready`, `aws`), so we build a custom image.

### One-time setup

```bash
# Build custom runner image with postgresql-client and awscli
cat > /tmp/Dockerfile.act << 'EOF'
FROM catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client python3-pip \
    && pip3 install awscli --break-system-packages \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
EOF
docker build -t act-runner:local -f /tmp/Dockerfile.act /tmp
```

### Create a secrets file

```bash
# /tmp/act-secrets.env
TEST_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte hex key>
TEST_PARA_USER_SHARE=<base64 user share>
```

### Run the e2e-vitest job

```bash
act push --job e2e-vitest \
  --secret-file /tmp/act-secrets.env \
  --platform ubuntu-latest=act-runner:local \
  --pull=false
```

`--pull=false` prevents act from trying to pull the local image from Docker Hub.

## Playwright Discovery Framework

Tools for understanding page structure before writing E2E tests. Solves the problem of guessing selectors blind, running the test, failing, and repeating.

### Commands

```bash
pnpm discover /                        # Discover unauthenticated page
pnpm discover / --auth --highlight     # Authenticated with numbered element overlays
pnpm discover / --steps "click:button:has-text('Sign In')" "wait:500" "probe:dialog"
pnpm discover / --json                 # JSON to stdout
```

### Output

Each probe writes to `tests/e2e/playwright/.probes/<label>-<timestamp>/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `screenshot.png` | Full page screenshot |
| `screenshot-highlighted.png` | Interactive elements with numbered red overlays |
| `elements.md` | Interactive elements table grouped by page region |
| `accessibility.md` | Parsed accessibility tree (roles, names, states) |
| `aria-snapshot.yaml` | Raw Playwright ARIA snapshot for writing `getByRole` locators |
| `diff.md` | What changed between two probes (new/removed elements, dialogs, toasts) |
| `report.json` | Full structured data |

### In-Test Usage

```typescript
import { probe, diffReports, autoProbe } from "./utils/discover";

// Manual probe at specific points
const before = await probe(page, "before-click");
await page.click('button:has-text("Sign In")');
const after = await probe(page, "after-click");
const diff = diffReports(before, after);

// Auto-probe on every URL change (only when PW_DISCOVER=1)
const handle = await autoProbe(page);
// ... test interactions ...
handle.stop();
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PW_DISCOVER=1` | Enable auto-probing on navigation in tests |
| `CI` | When set, disables auto-probing regardless of `PW_DISCOVER` |

### Explore Harness

`tests/e2e/playwright/explore.test.ts` is a scratchpad for iterative exploration:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e --grep "explore"              # Run exploration
PW_DISCOVER=1 pnpm test:e2e --grep "explore"  # With auto-probing
```

Edit the steps in the file, run, read `.probes/` output, edit again, repeat until you understand the page structure. Then write the real test in a new file.

### Future: React Component State Capture

The discovery framework currently captures the DOM layer (ARIA snapshots, interactive elements, screenshots). A potential enhancement is capturing **React component state** from the virtual DOM at failure points, giving both the "what the user sees" and "why it looks that way".

**What it would add beyond ARIA snapshots:**

| Signal | ARIA Snapshot | React VDOM |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Rendered output | Yes | No |
| Component hierarchy | No | Yes (`<WalletOverlay>` > `<Button>`) |
| Component props | No | Yes (`isLoading={true}`, `address="0x..."`) |
| Hook/atom state | No | Yes (jotai atoms, useState values) |
| Root cause of disabled state | Partial (sees `[disabled]`) | Yes (which prop/state caused it) |

**Concrete example from test debugging:**

When the Para wallet creation timed out, ARIA showed `button "Loading Creating..." [disabled]` -- enough to know it was stuck, but not why. React state would have shown `paraStatus: "pending"`, `apiError: null`, immediately confirming an API timeout vs an error state.

**Implementation approach:**

React exposes fiber nodes via `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` (dev builds) and `_reactFiber$` properties on DOM elements. A `probeReactState(page, selector)` function could:

1. Find the DOM element matching the selector
2. Walk up the fiber tree to find the nearest meaningful component boundary
3. Extract props, state, and hook values
4. Serialize and write to `.probes/` alongside the existing outputs

**Risks and constraints:**

- React fiber internals are **not a public API** and change between React versions (currently React 19)
- Full tree serialization is expensive and noisy -- should be **scoped to a subtree** around the failure point
- Only available in dev builds (production strips `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`)
- Circular references in state/props require careful serialization
- Jotai atoms may need special handling to extract readable values

**Recommended scope:** Targeted state capture at failure points (not full-tree analysis). Integrate into `probe()` as an optional `{ includeReactState: true }` flag that captures component state for the nearest React boundary around each interactive element.

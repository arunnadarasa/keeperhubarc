/**
 * POST /api/agentic-wallet/rotate-hmac  (Phase 37 fix #6)
 *
 * HMAC-authenticated rotation of the caller's agentic-wallet HMAC secret.
 * The request is signed with the caller's CURRENT highest-active secret. On
 * success the route mints a new 32-byte (64 hex char) secret at
 * keyVersion + 1, inserts it as the new active row, and stamps every
 * previously-active version with `expires_at = now() + 24h` so clients have
 * a 24-hour grace window to pick up the new secret before old ones stop
 * verifying.
 *
 * Response shape:
 *   200 { newSecret: string, keyVersion: number }
 *   401 { error }                           -- HMAC verification failed
 *   500 { error: "Rotate failed", code: "INTERNAL" }
 *
 * Grace-window stamping is done with a SINGLE UPDATE whose predicate
 * excludes the just-inserted row (`keyVersion != newVersion`) instead of the
 * plan's original two-UPDATE approach. The two-step form would briefly leave
 * the new active row with `expires_at = now + 24h` between the stamp-all and
 * un-stamp steps; a concurrent reader in that window would see the new
 * version as "expiring" even though it's the fresh default. The single
 * UPDATE avoids the transient state entirely.
 *
 * Concurrency: two concurrent rotations for the same sub-org would both read
 * currentVersion simultaneously, both pick newVersion = current + 1, both
 * attempt to insert. The PK constraint (sub_org_id, key_version) resolves
 * this by letting one INSERT win; the other throws and the route returns
 * 500. This is acceptable for a rare, rate-limited rotation (Wave 5 adds
 * rate limiting) — no transactional row-locking is needed today. A future
 * enhancement could wrap the read+insert in db.transaction with SELECT FOR
 * UPDATE if rotation contention ever becomes a real concern.

## kh update

Update kh to the latest version

### Synopsis

Update kh to the latest version by downloading the newest release from GitHub.

If kh was installed via Homebrew, this command will print the appropriate
brew command to use instead of replacing the binary directly. Homebrew manages
its own binary lifecycle and must be used to keep the installation consistent.

```
kh update [flags]
```

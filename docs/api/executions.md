# Executions API

Monitor and manage workflow executions.

## List Executions

```http
GET /api/workflows/{workflowId}/executions
```

Returns execution history for a workflow.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "exec_123",
      "workflowId": "wf_456",
      "status": "success",
      "input": {...},
      "output": {...},
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "completedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:05Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Get Execution Status

```http
GET /api/workflows/executions/{executionId}/status
```

Returns real-time execution status with progress tracking.

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "nodeStatuses": [
    { "nodeId": "node_1", "status": "success" },
    { "nodeId": "node_2", "status": "running" }
  ],
  "progress": {
    "totalSteps": 3,
    "completedSteps": 1,
    "runningSteps": 1,
    "currentNodeId": "node_2",
    "percentage": 33
  }
}
```

### Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Execution queued |
| `running` | Currently executing |
| `success` | Completed successfully |
| `error` | Failed with error |
| `cancelled` | Manually cancelled |

## Get Execution Logs

```http
GET /api/workflows/executions/{executionId}/logs
```

Returns detailed logs for each node in the execution.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "nodeId": "node_1",
      "nodeName": "Check Balance",
      "nodeType": "trigger",
      "status": "success",
      "input": {...},
      "output": {...},
      "duration": 1234,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Event Trigger Outputs**: When a workflow is triggered by a blockchain event, the trigger node's `output` object automatically includes block explorer links:
- `transactionLink` - Direct link to the transaction in the block explorer (when the event contains a transaction hash)
- `addressLink` - Direct link to the address in the block explorer (when the event contains an address)

These links are generated using the network's configured block explorer and are available in addition to the standard event data fields.

## Delete Executions

```http
DELETE /api/workflows/{workflowId}/executions
```

Bulk delete execution history for a workflow.

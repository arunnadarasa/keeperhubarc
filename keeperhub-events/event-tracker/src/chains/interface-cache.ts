/**
 * Cache of `ethers.Interface` instances keyed by a stable hash of the ABI.
 * Multiple workflows watching the same contract schema share one parsed
 * Interface; reconnects on a single workflow skip the parse entirely on
 * the second call.
 *
 * `ethers.Interface` is effectively immutable (it exposes decode/encode
 * against a parsed ABI and holds no network state), so sharing across
 * unrelated callers is safe.
 *
 * Bounded via a fixed-size LRU: under the in-process listener model
 * (KEEP-295 Phase 3+), one pod sees every distinct ABI ever registered
 * over its lifetime. Without eviction the cache would grow monotonically.
 * An insertion-ordered Map gives us LRU for free: delete-and-reinsert on
 * hit moves the entry to the end, and when we exceed MAX_CACHE_SIZE we
 * drop the iterator's first entry (the least recently used).

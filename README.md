# KeeperHub

A Web3 workflow automation platform (forked from vercel-labs/workflow-builder-template) that enables users **and Agents** to create, manage, and execute blockchain automation workflows and tasks. Supports smart contract monitoring, token transfers, DeFi operations, and integrations with Discord, SendGrid, webhooks and more.

## Core Value

Users and Agents can build and deploy Web3 automation workflows through a visual builder or with the [kh CLI](https://github.com/KeeperHub/cli) without writing code.

## Add KeeperHub to your Agent

**Quick setup (no install needed):**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http keeperhub https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to authorize via browser. That's it.

Try asking Claude to "create a workflow that monitors a wallet".

**Alternative: install the Claude Code plugin** for skills and slash commands:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add KeeperHub/claude-plugins
/plugin install keeperhub@keeperhub-plugins
/keeperhub:login
```

Restart Claude Code after setup. [Plugin source code](https://github.com/KeeperHub/claude-plugins/tree/main/plugins/keeperhub).

## What KeeperHub Does

- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for building blockchain automations
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: Read and write to smart contracts without writing code
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia, Base, Arbitrum, and more
- **Secure Wallet Management**: Para-integrated MPC wallets with no private key exposure
- **Notifications**: Email, Discord, Slack, and webhook integrations
- **Scheduling**: Cron-based, event-driven, webhook, or manual triggers
- **AI-Assisted Building**: Describe automations in plain language

## Key Features

### Triggers

- **Scheduled**: Run at intervals (every 5 minutes, hourly, daily, custom cron)
- **Webhook**: Execute when external services call your workflow URL
- **Event**: React to blockchain events (token transfers, contract state changes)
- **Manual**: On-demand execution via UI or API

### Actions

- **Web3**: Check Balance, Read Contract, Write Contract, Transfer Funds, Transfer Tokens
- **Notifications**: Send Email, Discord Message, Slack Message, Telegram Message
- **Integrations**: Send Webhook, custom HTTP requests

### Conditions

- Low balance detection
- Value comparisons
- Custom logic with AND/OR operators

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- pnpm package manager

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/keeperhub

# Authentication
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# AI (choose one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Para Wallet
PARA_API_KEY=your-para-api-key
PARA_ENVIRONMENT=beta

# Encryption
WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-wallet-encryption-key
INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-integration-encryption-key
```

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:push
pnpm dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to get started.

## Running Modes

### Local Development (Simplest)

For UI/API development without Docker:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:push
pnpm dev
```

### Dev Mode with Docker

Full development stack with scheduled workflow execution:

```bash
make dev-setup    # First time (starts services + migrations)
make dev-up       # Subsequent starts
make dev-logs     # View logs
make dev-down     # Stop services
```

Services: PostgreSQL (5433), LocalStack SQS (4566), Redis (6379), KeeperHub App (3000), Scheduler, Block Dispatcher, Event Tracker, Executor

### Hybrid Mode with K8s Jobs

For testing workflow execution in isolated K8s Job containers:

```bash
make hybrid-setup     # Full setup
make hybrid-status    # View status
make hybrid-down      # Teardown
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm type-check       # TypeScript check
pnpm check            # Run linter
pnpm fix              # Fix linting issues

# Database
pnpm db:push          # Push schema changes
pnpm db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:seed          # Seed chain data

# Plugins
pnpm discover-plugins # Scan and register plugins
pnpm create-plugin    # Create new plugin

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run all tests
pnpm test:e2e         # E2E tests
```

## Architecture

### Services

| Service | Description | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **App** | Next.js application with workflow builder UI and API | `app/`, `keeperhub/` |
| **Scheduler** | Evaluates cron schedules every minute, dispatches matching workflows to SQS | `keeperhub-scheduler/schedule-dispatcher/` |
| **Block** | Monitors blockchain blocks via WebSocket, dispatches matching workflows to SQS | `keeperhub-scheduler/block-dispatcher/` |
| **Event** | Monitors blockchain events and routes to SQS | `keeperhub-events/event-tracker/` |
| **Executor** | Polls SQS for all trigger types, executes workflows in-process or as K8s Jobs | `keeperhub-executor/` |
| **Workflow Runner** | Isolated container for executing web3 write workflows in K8s Jobs | `keeperhub-executor/workflow-runner.ts` |

All trigger services (scheduler, block, event) send messages to a shared SQS queue. The executor consumes from this queue and runs workflows in isolated K8s Job containers using the workflow-runner image. The execution mode is configurable via `EXECUTION_MODE`: `isolated` (default, all workflows in K8s Jobs), `complex` (K8s Jobs for web3 writes, in-process for everything else), or `process` (all in-process, no K8s).

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) with React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **UI**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Workflow Engine**: Workflow DevKit
- **Authentication**: Better Auth
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- **Wallets**: Para MPC integration

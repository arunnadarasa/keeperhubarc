import type { ProtocolAction } from "@/keeperhub/lib/protocol-registry";

/**
 * Returns the 18 standard ERC-4626 vault actions for a given contract key.
 * Use this in protocol definitions to avoid duplicating vault action boilerplate.
 *
 * 4 write actions: deposit, mint, withdraw, redeem
 * 14 read actions: asset, totalAssets, totalSupply, balanceOf, convertToAssets,
 *   convertToShares, previewDeposit, previewMint, previewWithdraw, previewRedeem,
 *   maxDeposit, maxMint, maxWithdraw, maxRedeem
 *
 * When a protocol has multiple ERC-4626 vaults, pass a slugPrefix to
 * disambiguate (e.g., "st-usds" produces "st-usds-vault-deposit").
 * The default (no prefix) produces "vault-deposit" for backwards compatibility.
 *
 * Pass `decimals` to override the default of 18 for vaults wrapping non-18-decimal
 * assets (e.g., USDC = 6, WBTC = 8).

// Aave V4 launched on Ethereum mainnet 2026-03-30 with a Hub-and-Spoke
// architecture. Users interact with Spokes (not Hubs) for supply/borrow.
// Each Spoke is tied to an ecosystem partner and has its own set of reserves
// identified by an opaque uint256 reserveId. Use `get-reserve-id` to resolve
// an asset into its reserveId before calling supply/withdraw/borrow/repay.
//
// This first cut exposes the Lido Spoke only - the most established of the
// six launch Spokes (Lido, EtherFi, Kelp, Ethena Correlated, Ethena
// Ecosystem, Lombard BTC). Additional Spokes can be added as contract
// entries sharing the same ABI.
//
// Integration tests are gated on the separate aave-v4-mainnet-onchain
// test file - no Sepolia V4 deployment exists at launch.
